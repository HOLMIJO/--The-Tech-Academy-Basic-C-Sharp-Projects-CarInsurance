# CarInsurance
Car Insurance Web Application written in C# MVC, and ADO.NET

This program works as an insurance estimator.
By allowing the user to input their personal information,
through a series of questions, the estimator determines 
a set base coverage rate, and adjusts any additional
rate increases based on the level and type of insurance
requested by the user.

The user profile is stored and the user has options to see details, 
edit or delete the profile in it's entirety.

User data is stored in a database.
